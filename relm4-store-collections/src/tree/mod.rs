//! Implementation of B-tree with order statistics
//! 
//! ## Rationale for custom implementation
//! 
//! In [std::collections::BTree] every operation is expressed in terms of key which implements
//! total order. This is not efficient or useful when you need to deal with user interface.
//!
//! For example, if you have a long list of todo tasks looking like
//! 
//! ```rust
//! struct Task {
//!   description: String,
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! And you would like to perform pagination (show first 50, 2nd 50, 3rd 50). Your list of tasks
//! is ordered by description.
//! 
//! ### Showing first 50 elements
//! 
//! To show first 50 elements, you can create an iterator from a tree and use first 50 elements only
//! 
//! ### Showing next page of elements
//! 
//! To show next page, you can take a range starting from last element of the page (exclusive) and
//! iterate next 50 elements
//! 
//! ### Showing previous page of elements
//! 
//! You can take a range ending (exclusive) at the first element of current page. But now you need
//! to iterate from the smallest element in the BTree to the first element of the current page and
//! build up a buffer of up to page of elements. If you are at the end of long list of tasks it's
//! becomes O(n) problem => slow
//! 
//! ### Showing arbitrary page of elements
//! 
//! You must iterate from start keeping a buffer of up to page elements to show => slow
//! 
//! ## Why standard crate is slow in ui use case?
//! 
//! The BTree in standard crate requires Ord but to perform fast in terms of the pagination you know
//! the distance between existing elements in the tree. That is in itself equivalent of keeping the
//! data in the continuos vector. If I can keep data in the vector, why would I use something so
//! complicated as a tree?
//! 
//! Let's go back to our `Task` example. Let's assume our tree is ordered by the description.
//! You must show to the user a page of the data (for example 50 tasks). 
//! 
//! 1. Description is the text.
//! 2. Description can be arbitrarily long.
//! 3. For simplicity case I assume that only small letters are allowed in description (no spaces, 
//! tabs, etc..). This simplification won't affect the conclusion. It will make some examples easier
//! to show.
//! 
//! So let's compute distance between some examples
//! 
//! * `dist("a", "a") = 0`, by definition
//! * `dist("a", "aa") = 1`, there is nothing which can go between `a` and `aa` in lexicographical
//! order
//! * `dist("a", "b") = âˆž`, there is infinite number of texts starting with letter `a`
//! 
//! This last property is reason why we use a tree to keep data and also one of the reasons why
//! BTree implementation doesn't work for ui. To be exact [`std::collections::BTree::range`]
//! function is useless if you can't predict distance between elements if you need to provide
//! page of data.
//! 
//! ## Differences between [std::collections::BTree] and [Tree]
//! 
//! TODO: Write list of differences between this types both internal and usage
