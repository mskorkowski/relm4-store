# Store

In this parts of the book we will deep dive into stores and all topics related to that. I would advise to read examples part of the book before reading this part. Examples tries to be a gentle introduction to what you need to develop your own application with `relm4-store`. This part of book should answer any question you have about the `relm4-store`. Why it was designed this way. How internals work. Also how to abuse the library to do your biding.
