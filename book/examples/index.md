# Examples

In the `relm4-store-examples/examples` you can find code for examples shown here. If it's the final code for the example it's placed in the folder ending with a number. For simple todo application it can be for example `todo_2` for the final version from chapter 2. If it's some kind of variation about the code for the application it's suffixed with extra description. For example `todo_2_single_scroll` shows custom scrollbar being used to navigate a long list.
