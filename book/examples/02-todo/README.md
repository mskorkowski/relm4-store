# Simple todo application with pagination

In first chapter we've implemented a simple todo application. It has one limitation, if our task list would grow big enough then view would be slow.

- We will generate 10000 tasks
- We will allow max 25 tasks at any given time
- We will implement pagination so we can navigate to see all of the data in the store

Whole source code can be found as example `todo_2`.

## Goals

- Describe StoreView in details
- Implement pagination for the list of tasks
