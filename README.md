## examples

There are two kinds of examples in the `relm4-store-examples` crate. First one are complete applications which and second one are some special cases of the first case. Special cases can be either modifications or snapshots of the state of code at some given point of the book. The first case has names either ending with a number indicating a version or doesn't have a version number at all. Second case after version number has some extra description about it's content. Examples of this can be seen in table below
